# STEP 1: ANCHOR UPLOAD
## NCLEX Lecture Development Pipeline

---

## PURPOSE

This step initiates the lecture development pipeline by uploading the anchor point content summaries document.

---

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR USER

1. Prepare your anchor point content summaries document
2. Ensure the document includes:
   - **Domain name** clearly indicated (e.g., "Fundamentals of Nursing" or "Pharmacology" or "Medical-Surgical Nursing")
   - **Numbered anchor points** (1, 2, 3... or 1., 2., 3...)
   - **One testable concept per anchor** - each anchor is a discrete piece of NCLEX-relevant content

3. Upload the document as-is (no preprocessing required)

---

## EXPECTED INPUT FORMAT

```
[DOMAIN NAME] Anchor Point Summaries

1. [Anchor point content summary - one testable concept]

2. [Anchor point content summary - one testable concept]

3. [Anchor point content summary - one testable concept]

...

N. [Final anchor point content summary]
```

---

## APPLICABLE NCLEX DOMAINS

This pipeline works for any NCLEX content domain, including:

- Fundamentals of Nursing (core concepts, basic care, nursing process)
- Pharmacology (drug classifications, mechanisms, interactions)
- Medical-Surgical Nursing (adult health, chronic/acute conditions)
- OB/Maternity Nursing (antepartum, intrapartum, postpartum, newborn)
- Pediatric Nursing (growth/development, pediatric conditions)
- Mental Health Nursing (psychiatric disorders, therapeutic communication)

---

## WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

After uploading the anchor document:

1. **Step 2: Lecture Mapping** - AI analyzes anchors across 5 phases to understand content and plan structure
2. **Step 3: Official Sorting** - AI assigns each anchor to a section using sorting rules
3. **Step 4: Outline Generation** - AI produces the final outline with sections, subsections, and slide counts

---

## OUTPUT

This step produces no output file. The uploaded document serves as input for Step 2.

---

## PROMPT TO INITIATE STEP 2

After uploading, use this prompt to begin Step 2:

```
Using the anchor point document I just uploaded, please execute Step 2: Lecture Mapping. Follow the 5-phase process to analyze content, discover clusters, map relationships, form sections, and generate arc planning iterations.
```
