## RELATIONSHIP TO PIPELINE

| Step | How This Document Applies |
|------|--------------------------|
| Step 1 (Upload) | Validate incoming anchor content against accuracy standards |
| Step 2 (Mapping) | Ensure clinical terminology consistency during analysis |
| Step 3 (Sorting) | Apply domain-specific content rules when categorizing |
| Step 4 (Outline) | Follow formatting standards in section organization |
| Step 6 (Blueprint) | Apply all content standards to slide generation |
| Step 8 (QA) | Validate against quality assurance checklist |

---

## I. CONTENT ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS

### 1.1 Evidence-Based Nursing Practice

All content MUST be grounded in evidence-based practice (EBP). When presenting clinical information:

**Required References:**
- American Nurses Association (ANA) standards
- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines
- Joint Commission standards
- National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) resources
- Peer-reviewed nursing journals (within 5 years)

**Verification Protocol:**
1. Cross-reference clinical facts with at least two authoritative sources
2. Verify medication information against current drug databases
3. Confirm procedure steps align with hospital policy standards
4. Ensure lab values match current reference ranges

**Prohibited:**
- Outdated practices (older than 5 years without current validation)
- Single-source claims for critical clinical information
- Anecdotal evidence presented as standard practice
- Regional variations presented as universal standards

---

### 1.2 NCLEX Test Plan Alignment

Content MUST align with the current NCLEX-RN Test Plan (updated every 3 years).

**Client Needs Categories Coverage:**

| Category | Weight | Content Requirements |
|----------|--------|---------------------|
| Safe and Effective Care Environment | 26-38% | Management, safety, infection control |
| Health Promotion and Maintenance | 6-12% | Prevention, screening, development |
| Psychosocial Integrity | 6-12% | Mental health, coping, communication |
| Physiological Integrity | 38-62% | Basic care, pharmacology, risk reduction |

**Integrated Processes:**
- Nursing Process (ADPIE)
- Caring
- Communication and Documentation
- Culture and Spirituality
- Teaching/Learning

**Activity Statement Alignment:**
- Each anchor point should map to at least one NCSBN activity statement
- Priority setting content must reflect current delegation guidelines
- Assessment content must follow systematic approaches

---

### 1.3 Clinical Guideline Compliance

Content must comply with current clinical practice guidelines:

**Primary Guideline Sources:**
- American Heart Association (AHA) - cardiac/BLS/ACLS
- American Diabetes Association (ADA) - diabetes management
- Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) - infection control
- Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) - ICU protocols
- Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) - surgical care

**Update Requirements:**
- Review guideline currency before content creation
- Flag content that may be affected by pending guideline updates
- Include "as of [date]" notation for rapidly evolving protocols

---

### 1.4 Medication Information Currency

Pharmacological content requires special accuracy verification:

**Required Verification:**
1. Drug names: Verify both generic and brand names are current
2. Dosages: Confirm recommended ranges from current formularies
3. Interactions: Cross-reference with drug interaction databases
4. Black box warnings: Include all current FDA warnings
5. Nursing implications: Verify monitoring parameters
