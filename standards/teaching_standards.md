# NCLEX Teaching Standards
## Comprehensive Guidelines for NCLEX Exam Preparation Instruction
## Version 1.0

---

## PURPOSE

This document establishes teaching standards for NCLEX exam preparation content generation. These standards govern the pedagogical approach, content delivery methodology, and domain-specific teaching strategies used throughout the pipeline.

**This is a reference document for all content-generating agents.** It should inform Steps 2-6 and presenter notes generation.

---

## RELATIONSHIP TO PIPELINE

| Document | Authority Over |
|----------|---------------|
| Teaching Standards (this) | Pedagogical approach, learning objectives, content emphasis |
| Presenting Standards | Delivery modes, timing, presenter notes format |
| Visual Layout Standards | Slide design, font sizes, spacing |
| nclex.yaml | Domain definitions, brand configuration |

When conflicts arise, Teaching Standards govern pedagogy; Presenting Standards govern delivery mechanics.

## I. NCLEX TEACHING PHILOSOPHY

### Core Principles

The NCLEX is not a knowledge test--it is a **clinical judgment assessment**. All teaching must reflect this reality.

#### 1. Exam-Focused Instruction Approach

**Primary Focus:** Prepare candidates to think like safe, competent entry-level nurses.

**Key Tenets:**
- Every concept taught must connect to potential exam applications
- Content is not complete until students understand HOW it will be tested
- Theory without application is incomplete instruction
- Safety implications must be explicit, not implied

**Implementation:**
- Frame content in terms of "What would the NCLEX ask about this?"
- Include question stem patterns in presenter notes
- Connect each anchor to at least one Client Needs category
- Anticipate and address common misconceptions proactively

---

#### 2. Clinical Judgment Emphasis

**Definition:** Clinical judgment is the observed outcome of critical thinking and decision-making. It reflects the nurse's ability to make judgments about what to observe, what observations are significant, and what actions to take.

**The NCSBN Clinical Judgment Measurement Model (CJMM):**

| Layer | Component | Teaching Focus |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Layer 0 | Clinical Context | Setting the scene, patient presentation |
| Layer 1 | Recognize Cues | What to observe, what's relevant |
| Layer 2 | Analyze Cues | Pattern recognition, hypothesis formation |
| Layer 3 | Prioritize Hypotheses | Most likely vs. least likely explanations |
| Layer 4 | Generate Solutions | Possible interventions |
| Layer 5 | Take Actions | Implementation decisions |
| Layer 6 | Evaluate Outcomes | Effectiveness assessment |

**Application in Teaching:**
- Present clinical scenarios that require cue recognition
- Ask "What would you notice first?" before "What would you do?"
- Distinguish between expected and unexpected findings
- Practice hypothesis generation and refinement
- Connect interventions to expected outcomes

---

#### 3. Priority Setting Skills

**The Foundation of NCLEX Success**

Priority questions comprise a significant portion of the exam. Candidates must master multiple priority frameworks:

**Framework 1: ABCs (Airway-Breathing-Circulation)**
- Airway ALWAYS trumps breathing
- Breathing ALWAYS trumps circulation
- Exception: Cardiac arrest (follow BLS algorithms)

**Framework 2: Maslow's Hierarchy**
- Physiological needs before safety
- Safety before love/belonging
- Love/belonging before esteem
- Esteem before self-actualization
- Physical before psychological (in exam context)

**Framework 3: Nursing Process (ADPIE)**
- Assessment before Diagnosis
- Diagnosis before Planning
- Planning before Implementation
- Implementation before Evaluation
- "Assess before you act" is the golden rule

**Framework 4: Acute vs. Chronic**
- Acute conditions take priority over chronic
- Unstable patients before stable patients
- New-onset symptoms before established symptoms

**Framework 5: Actual vs. Potential**
- Actual problems before potential problems
- Real data before risk factors
- Existing conditions before complications

**Teaching Priority Questions:**
- Always explain WHY one answer is more correct
- Practice "eliminating down to two" methodology
- Discuss the reasoning behind distractor appeal
- Use comparative analysis: "Both A and C are correct, but..."

---

#### 4. Safety-First Mindset

**The Ultimate NCLEX Filter**

When in doubt, choose safety. This principle must permeate all teaching.

**Safety Domains:**
1. **Patient Safety** - Preventing harm to the patient
2. **Nurse Safety** - Protecting the healthcare worker
3. **Environmental Safety** - Managing the care environment
4. **Medication Safety** - Rights, calculations, interactions
5. **Infection Control** - Standard and transmission-based precautions

**Safety Red Flags in Teaching:**
- "Never" statements require emphasis: Never recap needles, never leave bed rails down
- "Always" statements require context: Always check allergies, always verify identity
- "Immediately" triggers priority: Report immediately, intervene immediately

**When Teaching Safety Content:**
- Use case studies with near-misses
- Discuss real-world consequences
- Connect to state nursing practice acts
- Reference national patient safety goals (NPSG)

---

## II. CONTENT DELIVERY STANDARDS

### How to Present NCLEX Content

#### Structure: From Foundation to Application

Every topic should follow this arc:

```
Definition → Pathophysiology → Clinical Manifestations →
Nursing Assessment → Nursing Interventions → Patient Teaching →
NCLEX Application
```

**Simplified Version for Shorter Topics:**
```
What It Is → Why It Matters → What to Do → How It's Tested
```

---

#### Question Stem Patterns to Address

The following NCLEX question patterns must be explicitly taught:

**Priority Questions:**
- "Which action should the nurse take FIRST?"
- "Which client should the nurse see FIRST?"
- "Which assessment finding requires IMMEDIATE intervention?"
- "Which finding is the priority concern?"

**Delegation Questions:**
- "Which task can be delegated to the UAP/LPN?"
- "Which task requires an RN?"
- "Which assignment is appropriate?"
- "Which task can the charge nurse delegate?"

**Assessment Questions:**
- "Which finding would the nurse expect?"
- "Which data requires further assessment?"
- "Which statement indicates understanding?"
- "Which observation is most concerning?"

**Intervention Questions:**
- "Which intervention is most appropriate?"
- "Which action is contraindicated?"
- "Which response is therapeutic?"
- "Which teaching is accurate?"

**Select All That Apply (SATA):**
- Partial credit model--every correct option matters
- Teach systematic evaluation of each option
- No penalty for incorrect selections
- "Check all that apply" means possibly 1, possibly all

**Teaching Approach:**
- Include question stem type identification in presenter notes
- Practice recognizing priority language: "first," "immediately," "priority," "most important"
- Discuss how different stems change the correct answer
- Use the same clinical scenario with different question stems

---

#### Key Discriminators to Emphasize

**Discrimination = Exam Success**

The ability to distinguish between similar concepts separates passing from failing scores.

**Critical Discrimination Areas:**

| Area | Common Confusions | Teaching Focus |
|------|-------------------|----------------|
| Similar Medications | ACE inhibitors vs. ARBs | Suffix patterns, unique side effects |
| Similar Conditions | Crohn's vs. Ulcerative Colitis | Location, stool characteristics, complications |
| Lab Value Implications | Hypo- vs. Hyperkalemia | Cardiac effects, treatment differences |
| Developmental Stages | Piaget vs. Erikson | Cognitive vs. psychosocial focus |
| Leadership Styles | Autocratic vs. Democratic | When each is appropriate |
| Communication Techniques | Reflecting vs. Restating | Exact technique differences |

**Discrimination Teaching Techniques:**
- Side-by-side comparison tables
- "One is X, the other is Y" clear statements
- Mnemonics that highlight differences
- Practice questions that test discrimination

---

#### Common Test-Taking Errors to Highlight

Proactively address these common mistakes:

**Error 1: Reading Into the Question**
- Teach: Answer based only on information given
- Practice: "Don't assume information not provided"
- Example: If it doesn't say the patient is allergic, they're not allergic

**Error 2: Selecting Assessment When Action is Needed**
- Teach: Assess-before-act rule has exceptions
- Practice: Recognize emergencies requiring immediate intervention
- Example: Client in anaphylaxis--give epinephrine, don't assess more

**Error 3: Choosing "Notify the Provider" First**
- Teach: Nurses have independent actions
- Practice: What can you do before calling?
- Example: Collect more data, stabilize the patient, document

**Error 4: Absolute Language Blindness**
- Teach: "Always" and "never" are usually wrong
- Practice: Identify absolute language in options
- Exception: Safety absolutes are often correct

**Error 5: Picking the Most Detailed Answer**
- Teach: Length doesn't indicate correctness
- Practice: Evaluate content, not complexity
- Example: Short, correct answers are still correct

**Error 6: Not Reading All Options**
- Teach: Read every option before selecting
- Practice: "Best" answer may be the last one
- Example: A is good, but D is better

---

## III. LEARNING OBJECTIVES FRAMEWORK

### Bloom's Taxonomy Application for NCLEX

The NCLEX tests higher-order thinking. Learning objectives must reflect this.

#### Taxonomy Levels and NCLEX Application

| Level | Cognitive Process | NCLEX Application | Question Format |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Remember | Recall facts | Minimal--not primary focus | Direct knowledge questions |
| Understand | Explain concepts | Foundation for application | "Which statement indicates understanding?" |
| Apply | Use in new situations | Primary NCLEX focus | Clinical scenario application |
| Analyze | Break down, distinguish | High-yield for priority | "Which finding is most concerning?" |
| Evaluate | Make judgments | Delegation, supervision | "Which assignment is appropriate?" |
| Create | Synthesize new solutions | Care planning | "Which goal is most appropriate?" |

**Objective Writing Guidelines:**

**Level 1-2 (Foundation):**
- "Identify the mechanism of action of loop diuretics"
- "Describe the signs and symptoms of heart failure"

**Level 3-4 (Application/Analysis):**
- "Analyze assessment findings to prioritize nursing interventions"
- "Distinguish between expected and unexpected medication effects"

**Level 5-6 (Evaluation/Synthesis):**
- "Evaluate patient responses to determine intervention effectiveness"
- "Construct an appropriate discharge teaching plan"

**NCLEX Focus:** 70% of objectives should be Level 3 or higher.

|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Knowledge (What) | 20% | Definitions, lists, categories |
| Application (How) | 50% | Scenarios, procedures, interventions |
| Analysis (Why/Which) | 30% | Priority, discrimination, judgment |

**Teaching Progression:**
1. Establish knowledge foundation (brief)
2. Apply to clinical scenarios (majority)
3. Analyze for priority and discrimination (integration)

**Never teach knowledge in isolation.** Every fact should connect to application within the same subsection.

---

## IV. PEDAGOGICAL TECHNIQUES

### Active Recall Strategies

**Definition:** Active recall is the process of actively stimulating memory retrieval. It is more effective than passive review.

**Implementation in NCLEX Teaching:**

**Technique 1: Retrieval Practice Questions**
- Embed questions throughout content (not just at the end)
- Ask before revealing information: "What do you think happens when...?"
- Use "pause and recall" moments in presenter notes
- Mark with [RECALL] in presenter notes

**Technique 2: Self-Testing Prompts**
- "Before reading on, list three signs of..."
- "Can you recall the six rights of medication administration?"
- "What did we say about the difference between..."

**Technique 3: Elaborative Interrogation**
- Ask "Why?" after presenting facts
- "Why does this medication cause this side effect?"
- "Why would this patient present this way?"

**Technique 4: Practice Testing**
- NCLEX-style questions after each major concept
- Immediate feedback with rationale
- Spaced practice questions (revisit earlier content)

---

### Spaced Repetition Guidance

**Principle:** Information is better retained when reviewed at increasing intervals.

**NCLEX Application:**

**Within-Lecture Spacing:**
- Reference earlier concepts when teaching new ones
- "Recall from Section 1 that..."
- Build explicit bridges between sections
- Use callbacks in presenter notes

**Cross-Lecture Spacing:**
- Recommend review schedule in study guidance
- Flag high-priority concepts for repeated exposure
- Structure content for cumulative understanding

**Presenter Notes Inclusion:**
```
[SPACED REVIEW]: "This concept connects to the cardiac
content from last section. Ask students to recall the
relationship between potassium and cardiac function."
```

---

### Clinical Scenario Integration

**The Heart of NCLEX Teaching**

Every abstract concept must be grounded in clinical reality.

**Scenario Development Guidelines:**

**Structure:**
1. Setting (Where is this happening?)
2. Patient Profile (Who is the patient?)
3. Presenting Information (What do we know?)
4. Question/Decision Point (What must we determine?)

**Example Format:**
```
A 67-year-old male patient with a history of heart failure
is admitted with shortness of breath and bilateral lower
extremity edema. Current vital signs: BP 142/88, HR 98,
RR 24, SpO2 91% on room air.

What assessment finding would the nurse expect?
```

**Scenario Quality Criteria:**
- Clinically realistic (could happen in practice)
- Age-appropriate presentations
- Sufficient but not excessive detail
- Clear decision point requiring clinical judgment

**Scenario Complexity Progression:**
1. Single-concept scenarios (early in section)
2. Multi-concept integration (mid-section)
3. Priority/discrimination scenarios (synthesis)

---

### Mnemonic Usage Guidelines

**When to Use Mnemonics:**
- High-volume information that must be recalled
- Sequences that must be remembered in order
- Lists that are commonly tested
- Information where errors are dangerous

**When NOT to Use Mnemonics:**
- Concepts requiring understanding, not memorization
- Information better learned through application
- Content where the mnemonic is harder than the content

**Mnemonic Standards:**

**Effective Mnemonics:**
- Short and memorable
- Clinically relevant letters
- Well-established in nursing education
- Actually easier than the content itself

**Examples of High-Value NCLEX Mnemonics:**

| Mnemonic | Meaning | Use |
|----------|---------|-----|
| ADPIE | Assessment, Diagnosis, Planning, Implementation, Evaluation | Nursing Process |
| RACE | Rescue, Alarm, Confine, Extinguish | Fire response |
| SBAR | Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation | Communication |
| FAST | Face, Arms, Speech, Time | Stroke assessment |
| OLDCARTS | Onset, Location, Duration, Characteristics, Aggravating, Relieving, Treatment, Severity | Pain assessment |
| MONA | Morphine, Oxygen, Nitroglycerin, Aspirin | MI treatment |

**Presenter Notes Inclusion:**
- Introduce mnemonic with clear attribution
- Explain each letter explicitly
- Connect to clinical application
- Note: "This is a commonly tested mnemonic"

---

## V. ASSESSMENT INTEGRATION

### Practice Question Placement

**Placement Strategy:**

| Position | Purpose | Format |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Section Opening | Activate prior knowledge | Brief, foundation-level |
| Mid-Section | Check understanding | Application-level |
| Section End | Synthesis and integration | Analysis/evaluation-level |
| Vignette Slide | Formal assessment | Full NCLEX-style |

**Frequency Guidelines:**
- Minimum 1 practice question per subsection
- Section vignette is mandatory (per Presenting Standards)
- Additional retrieval practice at instructor discretion

---

### Answer Rationale Standards

**Every practice question requires comprehensive rationale.**

**Rationale Structure:**

```
CORRECT ANSWER: [Letter] - [Answer text]

RATIONALE: [2-3 sentences explaining WHY this is correct.
Connect to underlying principle or clinical reasoning.]

WHY OTHER OPTIONS ARE INCORRECT:
- A: [If not correct] - [Why this is wrong]
- B: [If not correct] - [Why this is wrong]
- C: [If not correct] - [Why this is wrong]
- D: [If not correct] - [Why this is wrong]

NCLEX TIP: [Test-taking strategy or content connection]
```

**Rationale Quality Criteria:**
- Explains the reasoning, not just restates the answer
- Addresses common misconceptions in distractors
- Connects to taught content
- Includes test-taking strategy when applicable

---

### Distractor Analysis

**Why Distractors Matter:**

Understanding why wrong answers are appealing teaches discrimination skills.

**Distractor Categories:**

| Type | Description | Teaching Point |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Partial Truth | Contains some correct information | "This is true, but incomplete" |
| Opposite Action | Reverses correct intervention | "This would cause harm" |
| Wrong Priority | Correct action, wrong timing | "This is important, but not first" |
| Different Patient | Would be correct for different scenario | "Consider who our patient is" |
| Common Misconception | Based on frequent error | "Many students choose this because..." |

**Teaching Distractor Analysis:**
- Don't just say "B is wrong"
- Explain why B looks appealing
- Discuss what error leads to selecting B
- Use distractors as teaching moments

---

## VI. DOMAIN-SPECIFIC TEACHING NOTES

### Fundamentals of Nursing Teaching Approach

**Core Philosophy:** Everything builds from here. Mastery of fundamentals is non-negotiable.

**Key Teaching Focuses:**

**1. Nursing Process (ADPIE)**
- This is the framework for ALL nursing care
- Assessment ALWAYS comes first (with rare exceptions)
- Diagnosis is NANDA-approved nursing diagnosis
- Planning includes measurable goals
- Implementation is nursing action
- Evaluation compares outcomes to goals

**2. Basic Care Skills**
- Vital signs interpretation (not just measurement)
- Positioning and body mechanics
- Hygiene and comfort measures
- Nutrition and hydration fundamentals
- Elimination management

**3. Documentation Standards**
- If it wasn't documented, it wasn't done
- Objective vs. subjective data
- Legal implications of charting
- Electronic health record basics

**4. Infection Control**
- Standard precautions apply to ALL patients
- Transmission-based precautions (contact, droplet, airborne)
- Hand hygiene as non-negotiable
- Sterile vs. clean technique

**Teaching Cautions:**
- Don't assume prior knowledge--verify fundamentals
- Emphasize "why" behind procedures
- Connect to safety at every opportunity

---

### Pharmacology Teaching Approach

**Core Philosophy:** Safe medication administration is a core nursing responsibility. Errors can be fatal.

**Key Teaching Focuses:**

**1. The Six Rights Plus**
- Right patient
- Right medication
- Right dose
- Right route
- Right time
- Right documentation
- PLUS: Right reason, right response

**2. Drug Classification System**
- Teach by class, not individual drugs
- Prototype drugs represent classes
- Suffix patterns (-olol, -pril, -sartan, -statin)
- Class-wide side effects vs. individual drug effects

**3. Pharmacokinetics Basics**
- Absorption (route matters)
- Distribution (where does it go?)
- Metabolism (liver function critical)
- Excretion (kidney function critical)

**4. Critical Drug Categories**
- High-alert medications (require extra verification)
- Sound-alike/look-alike drugs (TALL man lettering)
- Narrow therapeutic index drugs (monitoring required)
- Black box warning medications

**5. Patient Teaching Essentials**
- What the medication does
- How to take it correctly
- What side effects to expect
- When to contact provider

**Teaching Cautions:**
- Emphasize calculation accuracy--always double-check
- Never skip allergy verification
- Drug interactions are frequently tested
- Food-drug interactions often overlooked

---

### Medical-Surgical Nursing Teaching Approach

**Core Philosophy:** Apply pathophysiology to clinical presentation and nursing management systematically.

**Key Teaching Focuses:**

**1. Body Systems Approach**
- Cardiovascular: Prioritize based on tissue perfusion
- Respiratory: Airway always first
- Neurological: Level of consciousness is key indicator
- Gastrointestinal: Assess from mouth to anus
- Renal: Monitor intake and output, lab values
- Musculoskeletal: Safety and mobility
- Integumentary: First line of defense

**2. Pathophysiology Connection**
- Understand mechanism to predict presentation
- "If you know the patho, you know the symptoms"
- Connect interventions to pathophysiology

**3. Perioperative Care**
- Preoperative assessment and preparation
- Intraoperative safety (positioning, counts)
- Postoperative monitoring and complications

**4. Lab Value Interpretation**
- Normal ranges (know them cold)
- Clinical significance of abnormalities
- When to notify vs. when to monitor
- Critical values requiring immediate action

**5. Common Conditions Framework**
```
For each condition, teach:
- Definition/Pathophysiology
- Risk Factors
- Clinical Manifestations
- Diagnostic Tests
- Medical Management
- Nursing Interventions
- Patient Teaching
- Complications
```

**Teaching Cautions:**
- Don't teach conditions in isolation
- Connect related conditions (e.g., diabetes and cardiovascular disease)
- Emphasize early detection of deterioration
- Practice prioritization within complex patients

---

### OB/Maternity Nursing Teaching Approach

**Core Philosophy:** Two patients--mother and baby--with unique, interconnected needs.

**Key Teaching Focuses:**

**1. Antepartum Care**
- Normal pregnancy changes (expected vs. concerning)
- Prenatal assessment schedule
- Warning signs by trimester
- High-risk pregnancy identification

**2. Intrapartum Care**
- Stages of labor and nursing care for each
- Fetal heart rate monitoring interpretation
- Labor interventions (augmentation, analgesia)
- Complications requiring intervention

**3. Postpartum Care**
- Normal involution timeline
- Assessment priorities (BUBBLE-HE)
- Breastfeeding support
- Warning signs (hemorrhage, infection, preeclampsia)

**4. Newborn Care**
- APGAR scoring and interpretation
- Transitional care (first 24 hours)
- Normal vs. abnormal newborn findings
- Common newborn complications

**5. Fetal Heart Rate Patterns**
| Pattern | Description | Intervention |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Reassuring | Baseline 110-160, moderate variability | Continue monitoring |
| Early decelerations | Mirror contractions | No intervention (head compression) |
| Variable decelerations | Abrupt drops | Position change, check cord |
| Late decelerations | After contraction peak | Turn left, O2, stop Pitocin, notify MD |

**Teaching Cautions:**
- OB medications have unique considerations
- Know the emergency interventions (shoulder dystocia, cord prolapse)
- Maternal mortality is a current focus
- Cultural considerations in birth practices

---

### Pediatric Nursing Teaching Approach

**Core Philosophy:** Children are not small adults. Development determines care.

**Key Teaching Focuses:**

**1. Growth and Development**
- Developmental milestones by age
- Piaget's cognitive stages
- Erikson's psychosocial stages
- Implications for care delivery

**2. Age-Specific Assessment**
- Approaches vary by developmental stage
- Parent involvement considerations
- Fear and coping by age
- Pain assessment tools by age

**3. Pediatric Vital Signs**
| Age | Heart Rate | Respiratory Rate | Blood Pressure |
|-----|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Newborn | 120-160 | 30-60 | 60-90/20-60 |
| Infant | 100-150 | 30-60 | 74-100/50-70 |
| Toddler | 70-110 | 24-40 | 80-112/50-80 |
| Preschool | 65-110 | 22-34 | 82-110/50-78 |
| School-age | 60-95 | 18-30 | 84-120/54-80 |
| Adolescent | 55-85 | 12-20 | 94-140/62-88 |

**4. Common Pediatric Conditions**
- Respiratory illnesses (RSV, croup, asthma)
- Infectious diseases (vaccination-preventable)
- Congenital abnormalities
- Childhood cancers (leukemia presentation)

**5. Family-Centered Care**
- Parents as partners in care
- Sibling considerations
- Home care teaching for families
- Developmental regression during illness

**Teaching Cautions:**
- Medication dosing is ALWAYS weight-based
- Never assume parent knowledge
- Child abuse recognition is mandatory reporting
- Play is therapeutic and developmental

---

### Mental Health Nursing Teaching Approach

**Core Philosophy:** Therapeutic use of self is the primary intervention. Communication IS the treatment.

**Key Teaching Focuses:**

**1. Therapeutic Communication**
- Open-ended questions
- Reflecting and restating
- Silence as intervention
- Avoiding blocks to communication

**2. Mental Health Disorders**
For each disorder, teach:
- Diagnostic criteria (DSM-5-TR)
- Characteristic behaviors
- Nursing interventions
- Medication management
- Safety considerations

**3. Crisis Intervention**
- Crisis development stages
- De-escalation techniques
- Suicide risk assessment
- Homicide risk assessment
- Safety planning

**4. Psychopharmacology**
- Antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, MAOIs)
- Antipsychotics (typical, atypical)
- Mood stabilizers (lithium, anticonvulsants)
- Anxiolytics (benzodiazepines, buspirone)
- Side effect profiles and monitoring

**5. Legal and Ethical Considerations**
- Voluntary vs. involuntary admission
- Patient rights in psychiatric settings
- Restraint and seclusion guidelines
- Duty to warn (Tarasoff)

**Key Therapeutic Communication Responses:**

| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Open-ended question | "Tell me more about how you're feeling" |
| Reflection | "You seem frustrated" |
| Restating | "So you're saying that..." |
| Clarification | "Help me understand what you mean by..." |
| Silence | [Allow patient to continue] |
| Offering self | "I'll sit with you" |

**Non-Therapeutic Responses (Avoid):**
- Giving advice
- False reassurance
- Changing the subject
- Approval/disapproval
- "Why" questions
- Agreeing with delusions

**Teaching Cautions:**
- Mental health stigma must be addressed
- Safety assessment is ALWAYS priority
- Cultural considerations in mental health
- Substance use often co-occurs

---

## VII. EXAM STRATEGY INTEGRATION

### Test-Taking Strategies to Embed

**Strategy 1: Read the Question Twice**
- First read: Understand the scenario
- Second read: Identify what's being asked

**Strategy 2: Identify Key Words**
- Priority words: first, immediately, priority, most important
- Absolute words: always, never, all, none
- Qualifying words: usually, often, may, sometimes

**Strategy 3: Predict Before Reading Options**
- What would you do before seeing choices?
- Then find the option matching your prediction

**Strategy 4: Eliminate Systematically**
- Cross out obviously wrong answers
- Compare remaining options directly
- Select the "most correct" answer

**Strategy 5: Use Nursing Process**
- When in doubt, assess (unless emergency)
- Assessment before implementation
- Evaluation requires data

**Strategy 6: Apply ABC Priority**
- Airway first
- Then breathing
- Then circulation
- Then everything else
