# STEP 5: PRESENTATION STANDARDS
## Content Delivery Guidance for NCLEX Lecture Blueprints
## Domain-Agnostic Version

---

## PURPOSE

This document establishes presentation standards that inform blueprint generation (Step 6). These standards govern HOW content is delivered, not what content is taught (determined by Steps 2-4) or how slides appear visually (determined by templates).

**This is a reference document, not a prompt.** It should be provided alongside Step 6 when generating blueprints.

---

## RELATIONSHIP TO PIPELINE

| Step | Authority Over |
|------|---------------|
| Step 4 (Outline) | Structure, sections, subsections, anchor assignments |
| Step 5 (Standards) | Delivery modes, timing, presenter notes, active learning |
| Step 6 (Blueprint) | Slide-by-slide content specifications |

When conflicts arise, Step 4 structure governs. Step 5 informs delivery within that structure.

---

## SCOPE

**These standards govern:**
- Subsection delivery modes
- Timing and pacing guidance
- Presenter notes requirements
- Active learning integration
- NCLEX pattern communication
- Study strategy guidance

**These standards DO NOT govern:**
- Content selection or organization (see Step 4)
- Visual slide design (see templates)
- Text/font limitations (see Step 7)
- Anchor sorting decisions (see Step 3)

---

## I. SUBSECTION DELIVERY MODES

Each subsection from Step 4 is delivered using one of four modes based on anchor count and complexity.

### Mode Selection Criteria

| Mode | Anchor Count | Complexity | Structure |
|------|--------------|------------|-----------|
| Foundational | First subsection of section | Any | Overview → Scaffolding → Bridge |
| Full | 5+ anchors | High | Connection → Core → Synthesis |
| Minor | 3-4 anchors | Moderate | Connection → Core |
| One-and-Done | 1-2 anchors | Low | Single presentation unit |

---

### Foundational Mode

**Used for:** The first subsection of each section (establishes section foundation)

**Structure:**
1. **Overview** (3-5 min): Present organizing framework for the section
2. **Scaffolding** (variable): Build prerequisite concepts systematically
3. **Bridge** (1-2 min): Explicitly connect to subsequent subsections

**Slide Guidance:**
- Overview slide sets conceptual frame for entire section
- Scaffolding slides build foundational vocabulary and concepts
- Bridge slide previews what's coming and why foundation matters

---

### Full Mode

**Used for:** Subsections with 5+ anchors OR high complexity content

**Structure:**
1. **Connection** (1-2 min): Link to foundational subsection or prior content
2. **Core** (variable): Deliver anchor point content with active learning
3. **Synthesis** (3-5 min): Integrate concepts, provide applied relevance

**Slide Guidance:**
- Connection slide explicitly references prior knowledge
- Core slides cover each anchor with appropriate depth
- Synthesis slide pulls concepts together, shows relationships

---

### Minor Mode

**Used for:** Subsections with 3-4 anchors, moderate complexity

**Structure:**
1. **Connection** (1 min): Brief link to foundation
2. **Core** (variable): Focused anchor point delivery

**Slide Guidance:**
- Abbreviated connection (can be part of first content slide)
- Core slides cover anchors efficiently
- Synthesis deferred to section end or omitted

---

### One-and-Done Mode

**Used for:** Subsections with 1-2 anchors only

**Structure:**
- Single presentation unit with micro-connection to section foundation
- Self-contained context OR explicit "Recall that..." reference

**Slide Guidance:**
- 1-2 slides maximum
- Duration: 3-5 minutes total
- Include brief connection to section theme

---

## II. ANCHOR POINT DELIVERY RULES

### Primary Rule: Teach Once

Each anchor point is TAUGHT exactly once in its assigned section (per Step 3 sorting).
- Full treatment occurs in the primary section
- No re-teaching of previously covered anchors

### Reference Rule: Brief Callbacks

Anchors may be REFERENCED elsewhere when connections are valuable.
- References are brief (1-2 sentences maximum)
- Required phrasing: "Recall that..." or "As we covered..."
- Purpose: Connection only, not new instruction

### Cross-Reference Handling

For anchors flagged `[XREF]` in Step 3:
- Primary section: Full teaching
- Referenced section: Brief callback with explicit connection
- Presenter notes should include the callback script

---

## III. FIXED SLIDES PER SECTION

Each section includes 3 fixed slides in addition to content slides:

### 1. Section Intro Slide

**Position:** First slide of section

**Content:**
- Section title (header)
- Poetic/provocative quote related to section content (body)
- Quote should intrigue and prime the audience

**Presenter Notes:**
- Welcome to section
- Brief preview of what will be covered
- Connection to prior content (if not first section)
- Transition into first subsection

---

### 2. Vignette Slide (1 per section)

**Position:** Near section end (before answer slide)

**Format:** NCLEX-style clinical vignette
- 2-4 sentence stem presenting scenario
- 4 answer options (A, B, C, D)
- Stem should require integration of section concepts

**Presenter Notes:**
- Read vignette aloud
- Allow think time (30-60 seconds)
- Do NOT reveal answer on this slide

---

### 3. Answer Slide (1 per section)

**Position:** Immediately after vignette slide

**Content:**
- Correct answer identified
- Rationale for correct answer
- Brief explanation of why each distractor is wrong

**Presenter Notes:**
- Reveal and explain correct answer
- Walk through distractor analysis
- Connect back to anchor concepts tested
- Identify NCLEX patterns if applicable

---

## IV. TIMING AND PACING GUIDANCE

### Pacing Philosophy

- Quality over speed—never sacrifice instruction for time
- Match pace to content complexity
- Allow concepts to develop fully before moving forward
- Content decisions are at instructor discretion

### Word Count Guidelines

Presenter notes should follow these word counts based on target slide duration:

| Slide Duration | Word Count |
|----------------|------------|
| 1 minute | 130-150 words |
| 2 minutes | 260-300 words |
| 3 minutes | 390-450 words (maximum recommended) |

**Maximum:** Presenter notes should not exceed 180 seconds of spoken dialogue (~390-450 words).

**Adjustment:** Reduce word count by 20% for slides with active learning components to allow response time.

### Transitions

Transitions between slides and subsections should be natural and efficient.
- No rigid time cap—flexibility based on content
- Include brief recap of completed content
- Preview upcoming content
- Make explicit connections between topics

---

## V. PRESENTER NOTES REQUIREMENTS

### Verbatim Monologue Standard

Every slide MUST include a complete, verbatim monologue in presenter notes.

**Specifications:**
- Written word-for-word as intended to be spoken
- Complete sentences, not bullet points or keywords
- Includes all transitions, emphasis points, and rhetorical questions
- Covers the full duration allocated to that slide

**Must Include:**
- Opening statement for the slide
- Explanation of each concept on the slide
- Applied relevance or significance statements
- Connection to previous or upcoming content (where applicable)
- Closing transition to next slide

### Formatting Markers

Use these markers in presenter notes:

| Marker | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `[PAUSE]` | Deliberate pause for processing or emphasis |
| `[EMPHASIS]` | Key term to stress vocally |

**Example:**
```
Let's talk about the relationship between X and Y. [PAUSE]

This is critical because [EMPHASIS: mechanism] directly determines
the outcome we observe clinically.
```

---

## VI. NCLEX PATTERN COMMUNICATION

### Pattern Flagging in Presenter Notes

Presenter notes should explicitly call out NCLEX testing patterns where applicable.

**Include:**
- Common question formats for this content
- Frequent distractor types
- "Trap" answer patterns to watch for
- How NCLEX typically phrases questions on this topic

**Example Phrasing:**
- "NCLEX often tests this by asking..."
- "Watch for distractors that confuse X with Y..."
- "The exam typically presents this as a 'which is MOST likely' question..."

### Vignette Relevance

Vignettes should reflect NCLEX testing patterns:
- Realistic clinical/applied scenarios
- 2-4 sentence stems (NCLEX standard length)
- Plausible distractors based on common misconceptions
- Clear correct answer with defensible rationale

---

## VII. ACTIVE LEARNING INTEGRATION

### Retrieval Practice

Each subsection should include at least one retrieval practice opportunity:
- NCLEX-style question
- Brief case application
- Concept check

### Active Learning Slide Guidance

For slides with active learning components:
- Pose question/prompt before revealing answer
- Allow processing time (minimum 30 seconds simple, 60+ seconds complex)
- Provide complete rationale
- Reduce presenter notes word count by 20%

---

## VIII. STUDY STRATEGY GUIDANCE

### Within-Lecture Guidance

Presenter notes may include brief study strategy mentions:
- Spaced repetition recommendations
- Active recall emphasis
- Effective retention strategies
- Focus areas for self-study

**Example Phrasing:**
- "This concept pairs well with [related topic] for review..."
- "When studying this, focus on the distinguishing features..."
- "Practice applying this to novel scenarios..."

### Avoid

- Do not mention tiers or priority levels
- Do not rank content as "high-yield" vs. "low-yield"
- Present all content as important for mastery

---

## IX. SECTION EXCEPTION HANDLING

### Misc Section (if present from Step 4)

- No foundational subsection required
- Present as standalone conceptual content
- Group by theme, not by arc structure
- May use One-and-Done mode for most subsections

### Culmination Section (if present from Step 4)

- No foundational subsection (prior sections serve as foundation)
- Open with connection slide: "Now we integrate..."
- Leverage all prior section knowledge explicitly
- Presenter notes should reference specific prior sections

---

## X. DOMAIN ADAPTATION

These standards apply across all NCLEX domains. When generating blueprints:

1. **Extract domain context** from Step 4 output
2. **Adapt examples** to domain-appropriate scenarios
3. **Match terminology** to domain conventions
4. **Scale complexity** to domain norms

### Domain-Specific Considerations

| Domain Type | Typical Adaptations |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Biological | Emphasize mechanism → effect relationships |
| Clinical | Emphasize diagnostic reasoning and presentation patterns |
| Treatment | Emphasize technique application and evidence base |
| Developmental | Emphasize stage progression and milestone patterns |
| Ethics | Emphasize principle application and decision reasoning |
| Research | Emphasize design logic and interpretation |
| Social/Cultural | Emphasize contextual factors and group processes |

---
