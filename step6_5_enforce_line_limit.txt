STEP 6.5: ENFORCE 8-LINE BODY LIMIT
================================================================================

ROLE: Blueprint Line Count Enforcer

TASK:
Review the blueprint and ensure EVERY slide's BODY section has no more than 8 lines (bullet points or text lines).

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Count ONLY non-empty lines in the BODY section
2. Maximum allowed: 8 lines
3. Blank lines don't count
4. Sub-bullets (lines starting with -) count as separate lines
5. If a slide exceeds 8 lines, condense it strategically

CONDENSATION STRATEGY (in order of priority):
1. Combine related sub-bullets into fewer, more concise points
2. Remove redundant information that's implied or stated elsewhere
3. Prioritize NCLEX-testable information
4. Use more concise phrasing
5. Remove examples if necessary (can go in presenter notes)
6. Keep the most clinically/exam-relevant points

WHAT TO PRESERVE:
- Core clinical concepts
- NCLEX-testable distinctions
- Key diagnostic criteria
- Critical differences/comparisons
- Primary mechanisms

WHAT CAN BE CONDENSED/REMOVED:
- Redundant explanations
- Overly detailed examples
- Information better suited for presenter notes
- Secondary details
- Descriptive modifiers

EXAMPLE - BEFORE (10 lines - TOO MANY):
BODY:
The parasympathetic nervous system reverses sympathetic activation:

• Slows heart rate and respiration
• Lowers blood pressure
• Redirects blood to digestive organs
• Promotes relaxation and recovery
• Known as "rest and digest" or "feed and breed"

• Activated by: Deep breathing, relaxation techniques, vagal stimulation

Clinical relevance: Important for understanding anxiety treatment

EXAMPLE - AFTER (8 lines - COMPLIANT):
BODY:
The parasympathetic nervous system reverses sympathetic activation:

• Slows heart rate and respiration
• Lowers blood pressure
• Redirects blood to digestive organs
• Promotes relaxation and recovery
• Known as "rest and digest" or "feed and breed"
• Activated by deep breathing, relaxation techniques, vagal stimulation

[Note: Moved "Clinical relevance" detail to PRESENTER NOTES]

VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
For each slide, count the non-empty lines in BODY section:
□ Is line count ≤ 8?
□ If no, condense using strategy above
□ Verify no essential NCLEX content was removed
□ Confirm key clinical points remain
□ Check that condensed version is still clear and accurate

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return the complete revised blueprint with all slides compliant with the 8-line limit.

Annotate any slides where significant condensation was needed:
