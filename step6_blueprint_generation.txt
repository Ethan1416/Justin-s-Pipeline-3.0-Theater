# STEP 6: BLUEPRINT GENERATION
## Slide-by-Slide Content Specification
## Domain-Agnostic Version

---

## PURPOSE

This step generates a complete slide-by-slide blueprint for ONE section at a time. The blueprint specifies exact content for each slide including header, body, NCLEX tip, and presenter notes.

Run this step once per section from Step 4 output.

---

## INPUT

**Required:**
1. Step 4 output file (`step4_output_[domain]_[date].txt`)
2. Step 5 Presentation Standards (reference document)
3. Section to generate (specify which section from Step 4)

**From Step 4, extract for the target section:**
- Section name
- Subsection names and anchor assignments
- Anchor summaries
- Frontload flags
- Cross-reference flags
- Prerequisite sections (for connection references)

---

## OUTPUT

**Primary Output:** `step6_blueprint_[domain]_[section]_[date].txt`

Contains slide-by-slide specifications with:
- Slide numbers (absolute within section)
- Slide type designation
- Header text
- Body text
- NCLEX tip text (where applicable)
- Presenter notes (verbatim monologue)

---

## DOMAIN ADAPTATION

Before generating:

1. **Extract domain name** from Step 4 output
2. **Note domain conventions** for terminology and examples
3. **Adapt vignette style** to domain-appropriate scenarios
4. **Match applied relevance** to domain context

---

## BLUEPRINT GENERATION PROCESS

### Step 1: Analyze Section Structure

From Step 4, identify:
- Number of subsections
- Anchors per subsection
- Delivery mode for each subsection (per Step 5 standards)
- Total estimated content slides
- Fixed slides needed (3: intro, vignette, answer)

### Step 2: Determine Slide Sequence

Map out slide sequence:

```
Slide 1: Section Intro (fixed)
Slides 2-N: Subsection 1 content (mode-based)
Slides N+1-M: Subsection 2 content (mode-based)
[Continue for all subsections...]
Slide X: Vignette (fixed)
Slide X+1: Answer (fixed)
```

### Step 3: Apply Delivery Modes

For each subsection, apply the appropriate mode from Step 5:

**Foundational Mode (first subsection):**
- Overview slide(s)
- Scaffolding slides
- Bridge slide

**Full Mode (5+ anchors):**
- Connection slide
- Core content slides
- Synthesis slide

**Minor Mode (3-4 anchors):**
- Connection (brief, may combine with first content slide)
- Core content slides

**One-and-Done Mode (1-2 anchors):**
- Single presentation unit (1-2 slides)

### Step 4: Generate Each Slide

For each slide, produce:
1. Slide number
2. Slide type
3. Header text
4. Body text
5. NCLEX tip (if applicable)
6. Presenter notes

### Step 5: Light Validation

At end of blueprint, list:
- All anchors covered (by summary)
- Any anchors from Step 4 not addressed (should be none)

## CONTENT GENERATION GUIDELINES

### Header Text

- Clear, descriptive titles
- Should convey slide topic at a glance
- 1-2 lines maximum
- Avoid jargon in titles (use in body)

### Body Text

**Format based on content type:**

| Content Type | Recommended Format |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Definitions/concepts | Bullet points |
| Processes/sequences | Numbered list |
| Comparisons | Side-by-side or table format |
| Single complex idea | Prose paragraph |
| Multiple related points | Bullet points |

**Guidelines:**
- Target 3-8 lines (max 8)
- Mixed format acceptable
- Prioritize clarity over density
- One main idea per slide when possible

**⚠️ CRITICAL CONSTRAINT - BODY LINE LIMIT:**
- **MAXIMUM 8 non-empty lines** in BODY section per slide
- Count ALL non-empty lines: bullet points, sub-bullets, and text lines
- Blank lines don't count toward limit
- If content exceeds 8 lines:
  - Combine related sub-bullets into single lines
  - Move detailed explanations to PRESENTER NOTES
  - Split complex content across multiple slides
  - Use more concise phrasing
- Violating this limit will cause PowerPoint generation failures

### NCLEX Tip Text

- Present on all content slides
- Omit for Section Intro, Vignette, and Answer slides
- 1-2 lines maximum
- Focus on testing patterns, common confusions, or key discriminations

**Good NCLEX Tips:**
- "NCLEX often asks about X in the context of Y"
- "Don't confuse X with Y—look for [distinguishing feature]"
- "This concept frequently appears as a distractor when testing Z"
- "Key discrimination: X involves [feature], while Y involves [feature]"

### Presenter Notes

Follow Step 5 standards:
- Verbatim monologue (complete sentences)
- 130-150 words per minute
- Maximum 180 seconds per slide
- Include `[PAUSE]` and `[EMPHASIS]` markers
- Include NCLEX pattern callouts
- Include transitions

---

## SUBSECTION MODE IMPLEMENTATION

### Foundational Mode Slides

**Overview Slide(s):**
- Present organizing framework for section
- Big-picture context
- Why this content matters

**Scaffolding Slides:**
- Build prerequisite concepts systematically
- Foundational vocabulary
- Core relationships

**Bridge Slide:**
- Connect foundation to upcoming subsections
- Preview section arc
- Transition statement

### Full Mode Slides

**Connection Slide:**
- Explicit reference to foundational subsection
- "Building on [concept from foundation]..."
- Link to prior knowledge

**Core Slides:**
- Cover assigned anchors thoroughly
- Active learning integration
- NCLEX tips on each

**Synthesis Slide:**
- Pull concepts together
- Show relationships between anchors
- Applied relevance

### Minor Mode Slides

**Connection (brief):**
- May be integrated into first content slide
- 1-2 sentences linking to foundation

**Core Slides:**
- Efficient anchor coverage
- NCLEX tips on each

### One-and-Done Slides

- Self-contained 1-2 slides
- Micro-connection to section theme
- Brief but complete treatment

---

## ANCHOR COVERAGE

### Referencing Anchors

- Reference anchors by summary (not number)
- Each anchor should be clearly covered on one or more slides
- Complex anchors may span multiple slides
- Simple anchors may share slides

### Frontload Handling

For anchors flagged `[FRONTLOAD]` in Step 3/4:
- Position early in subsection
- These establish concepts needed for later anchors
- Presenter notes should emphasize foundational nature

### Cross-Reference Handling

For anchors flagged `[XREF]` in Step 3/4:
- Full teaching in primary section
- Brief callback script in presenter notes for reference section
- Use "Recall that..." or "As we covered..." phrasing

---

## VIGNETTE CONSTRUCTION

### Domain-Appropriate Scenarios

| Domain | Vignette Style |
|--------|---------------|
| Biological | Patient presentation with symptoms/findings |
| Clinical | Diagnostic scenario or case presentation |
| Treatment | Intervention decision or technique application |
| Developmental | Age-appropriate behavior or milestone question |
| Ethics | Professional dilemma or decision scenario |
| Research | Study design or interpretation question |
| Social/Cultural | Contextual factors or group dynamics scenario |

### Vignette Requirements

- 2-4 sentence stem (NCLEX standard)
- Requires integration of section concepts
- One clearly correct answer
- Three plausible distractors based on common misconceptions
- Distractor analysis prepared for answer slide
