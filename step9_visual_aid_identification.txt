# STEP 9: VISUAL AID IDENTIFICATION & DESIGN
## Candidate Selection and Visual Specification
## Domain-Agnostic Version - EXPANDED TRIGGERS
## Updated: 2025-12-25 - Enhanced Pattern Recognition

---

## PURPOSE

This step analyzes QA-passed blueprints to identify slides that would benefit from visual aids, then generates detailed specifications for 7 types of graphic organizers. Visual aids enhance learning by presenting complex information in accessible formats.

**Supported Visual Types (7 total, in revised priority order):**
1. **Tables** - Comparisons, organized data, mechanism summaries (MOST VERSATILE - HIGHEST PRIORITY)
2. **Key Differentiators** - Discrimination between similar concepts (HIGH PRIORITY)
3. **Flowcharts** - Sequential processes, mechanisms, protocols
4. **Decision Trees** - Diagnostic decisions, classification systems, algorithms
5. **Hierarchy Diagrams** - Classifications, taxonomies, anatomical structures
6. **Timelines** - Chronological events, developmental stages, historical progression
7. **Spectrums** - Continuums, severity scales, gradients

**Removed from pipeline:** Venn Diagrams, Cycle Diagrams (use TABLE as fallback)

This step runs AFTER Step 8 (QA) passes with a score of 90+.

## REVISED PRIORITY RATIONALE

**Why TABLE is now #1:**
- Most versatile across all disciplines
- Handles comparisons, mechanisms, profiles, risk factors, criteria
- Reliable PowerPoint rendering
- Works as fallback for nearly any organized content
- Dominant pattern in physiological, pharmacological, and clinical content

**Why KEY_DIFFERENTIATORS is #2:**
- Critical for discrimination learning across all disciplines
- High pedagogical value for retention and application
- Common in clinical, diagnostic, and treatment contexts

**Why FLOWCHART elevated to #3:**
- Essential for mechanism understanding (physiology, pharmacology)
- Treatment protocols and procedures
- Process sequences (physiological responses, drug actions)
- More common than originally assessed in technical disciplines

**Remaining order (4-7):**
- DECISION_TREE: Specialized diagnostic/treatment algorithms
- HIERARCHY: Classification structures, anatomical organization
- TIMELINE: Developmental/historical content (discipline-dependent)
- SPECTRUM: Continuum content (least common, most specialized)

---

## MANDATORY MINIMUM VISUAL REQUIREMENT

**CRITICAL: Every section MUST have at least 2-3 graphic organizers.**

This is NOT optional. Visual aids are essential for learning - they help students discriminate between similar concepts, organize complex information, and retain high-yield content.

### Minimum Quotas

| Section Size | Minimum Visuals | Target Visuals |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 12-15 slides | 2 | 3-4 |
| 16-20 slides | 3 | 4-5 |
| 21-25 slides | 3 | 5-6 |
| 26-35 slides | 4 | 6-8 |

### Proactive Visual Identification Triggers

Even if a slide doesn't meet formal conditions, consider visuals for:
- Any slide with 4+ bullet points → TABLE
- Any slide comparing 2+ items on any dimension → TABLE or KEY_DIFFERENTIATORS
- Any slide listing criteria, symptoms, features, or properties → TABLE
- Any slide with a process or mechanism (even implicit) → FLOWCHART or TABLE
- Any slide with classification criteria → DECISION_TREE or TABLE
- Any slide describing similar items with key differences → KEY_DIFFERENTIATORS

---

## EXPANDED CANDIDATE IDENTIFICATION CONDITIONS

Use the following conditions to identify slides that warrant visual aids. A slide is a STRONG CANDIDATE if it meets 2+ conditions. A slide is a POSSIBLE CANDIDATE if it meets 1 condition.

**IMPORTANT: Auto-Detection Priority Order**
When multiple visual types could apply, use this priority:
1. TABLE - for organized data, comparisons, mechanisms, profiles (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
2. KEY_DIFFERENTIATORS - for discrimination/differential content (HIGH PRIORITY)
3. FLOWCHART - for sequential processes, mechanisms, protocols
4. DECISION_TREE - for branching diagnostic/classification logic
5. HIERARCHY - for classification/taxonomy/anatomical structures
6. TIMELINE - for chronological/developmental sequences
7. SPECTRUM - for continuums/severity scales
