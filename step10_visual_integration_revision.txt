# STEP 10: VISUAL INTEGRATION REVISION
## Contextual Integration of Visual Aids into Blueprint
## Domain-Agnostic Version

---

## PURPOSE

This step integrates the visual aid specifications from Step 9 into the blueprint, revising surrounding content for seamless incorporation. This is the "third revision" that ensures visuals are contextually connected to the lecture flow.

---

## INPUT

**Required:**
1. Step 9 visual specifications (`step9_visual_specs_[domain]_[section]_[date].txt`)
2. Step 7 revised blueprint (`step7_revised_[domain]_[section]_[date].txt`)
3. Step 4 outline (for structure reference)
4. Step 5 presentation standards (for delivery mode reference)

---

## OUTPUT

**Primary Output:** `step10_integrated_blueprint_[domain]_[section]_[date].txt`
- Complete blueprint with visuals integrated
- All surrounding slides updated
- Presenter notes revised
- Ready for PowerPoint generation

**Secondary Output:** `step10_revision_changelog_[domain]_[section]_[date].txt`
- Detailed log of all changes made
- Rationale for each modification

---

## INTEGRATION PHILOSOPHY

### Seamless Flow

Visual aids should feel like natural parts of the lecture, not interruptions. The revision must:
- Create smooth transitions INTO visual content
- Create smooth transitions OUT OF visual content
- Reference visuals explicitly in presenter notes
- Connect visuals to surrounding anchor points

### Maintain Instructional Integrity

While integrating visuals:
- Preserve all anchor point coverage
- Maintain section learning objectives
- Respect delivery mode structure (Foundational, Full, Minor, One-and-Done)
- Honor prerequisite relationships

### Adhere to Existing Standards

All revisions must comply with:
- Character limits (Header: 32 chars, Body: 66×8, Tip: 66×2)
- Presenter notes limits (180 seconds max)
- Slide count constraints (Section: 12-35, Session: 72-90)
- Fixed slide requirements (Intro, Vignette, Answer per section)

---

## REVISION CONDITIONS

### Condition R1: Pre-Visual Transition
**Trigger:** Slide immediately before a visual
**Action:** Add transition language in presenter notes
**Phrasing Examples:**
- "Let's look at this visually to clarify the relationships..."
- "The following diagram will help you see how these elements connect..."
- "I want to show you a table that organizes what we just discussed..."

### Condition R2: Post-Visual Connection
**Trigger:** Slide immediately after a visual
**Action:** Add connection language in presenter notes
**Phrasing Examples:**
- "As you saw in the table..."
- "Building on that diagram..."
- "Now that you can visualize the process..."

### Condition R3: Visual Slide Presenter Notes
**Trigger:** Slide containing the visual itself
**Action:** Write presenter notes that WALK THROUGH the visual
**Requirements:**
- Verbatim monologue (not bullet points)
- Reference specific elements of the visual
- Explain how to read/interpret the visual
- Connect to anchor point content
- 130-150 words per minute, max 180 seconds

### Condition R4: Redundancy Reduction
**Trigger:** Visual replaces slide body (Integration Option A)
**Action:** Ensure no redundant text remains
**Guidelines:**
- Remove body text that visual now conveys
- Keep header if still relevant
- Update presenter notes to teach from visual, not text

### Condition R5: Cross-Reference Updates
**Trigger:** Other slides in section reference content now in visual
**Action:** Update references to point to visual
**Phrasing Examples:**
- "As shown in our earlier comparison table..."
- "Referring back to the decision tree we reviewed..."
- "Remember the diagram showing..."

### Condition R6: NCLEX Tip Handling
**Trigger:** Slide converted to visual slide
**Action:** Remove NCLEX tip (visual slides don't need tips)
**Note:** If tip contained critical testing insight, incorporate into presenter notes

### Condition R7: Subsection Flow Preservation
**Trigger:** Visual added within subsection
**Action:** Verify subsection delivery mode structure intact
**Check:**
- Foundational mode: Overview → Scaffolding → Bridge (still present?)
- Full mode: Connection → Core → Synthesis (still present?)
- Minor mode: Connection → Core (still present?)
- One-and-Done: Self-contained unit (still works?)

### Condition R8: Section Fixed Slides Protection
**Trigger:** Any revision near fixed slides
**Action:** Ensure fixed slides remain intact
**Fixed Slides:**
- Section Intro (Slide 1)
- Vignette (near section end)
- Answer (after vignette)
**Rule:** These slides should NOT be converted to visuals

---

## REVISION PROCESS

### Phase 1: Visual Integration

For each visual from Step 9:

1. **Locate target slide** in Step 7 blueprint
2. **Apply integration option** (A, B, or C from Step 9)
3. **Insert/modify content** per visual specification
4. **Update slide header** if needed
5. **Write/revise presenter notes** per Condition R3
6. **Handle NCLEX tip** per Condition R6

### Phase 2: Surrounding Slide Updates

For slides affected by visual integration:

1. **Identify slides before visual** → Apply Condition R1
2. **Identify slides after visual** → Apply Condition R2
3. **Identify cross-references** → Apply Condition R5
4. **Check for redundancies** → Apply Condition R4

### Phase 3: Structure Validation

Verify section structure remains sound:

1. **Check subsection flow** → Condition R7
2. **Verify fixed slides** → Condition R8
3. **Count total slides** → Confirm within 12-35
4. **Validate character limits** → All revised text compliant

### Phase 4: Changelog Documentation

Document every change made:
- Slide number
- Change type
- Before/after content
- Rationale

## PRESENTER NOTES FOR VISUAL SLIDES

### Template: Table Slides

```
PRESENTER NOTES:

Let me show you this information in a table format to make the relationships clearer. [PAUSE]

Looking at our [table title], you'll see [number] [rows/columns] that organize [topic description].

Starting with the first [column/row], [explanation of first element]. Notice how this [connects to/contrasts with] [related element]. [PAUSE]

Moving to [next element], [explanation]. This is particularly important because [EMPHASIS: key point] directly relates to [anchor point reference].

[Continue for remaining elements...]

The key takeaway from this table is [synthesis statement]. When you see NCLEX questions about [topic], you can mentally reference this organization to [application guidance].

[Transition to next slide]

[Word count: 130-150 per minute, max 450 words]
```

### Template: Decision Tree Slides

```
PRESENTER NOTES:

This decision tree will help you navigate [topic] systematically. [PAUSE]

We start at the top with the question: [starting question]. This is your entry point for any [scenario type].

If the answer is [YES/first option], we move to [next node]. Here, we ask [next question]. [Explain the logic behind this branch].

If instead the answer is [NO/second option], we follow this path to [alternative node]. [EMPHASIS: key distinction] is what separates these two paths.

[Continue walking through the tree...]

Notice that all paths eventually lead to [terminal outcomes]. The NCLEX loves to test your ability to [application of decision process]. When you encounter [scenario type], mentally walk through this tree.

[Transition to next slide]

[Word count: 130-150 per minute, max 450 words]
```

### Template: Flowchart Slides

```
PRESENTER NOTES:

Let's trace through this process step by step using this flowchart. [PAUSE]

We begin with [starting point]. From here, the first step is [Step 1 description]. This is foundational because [rationale].

Next, we move to [Step 2]. Notice the arrow indicating [direction/sequence]. [EMPHASIS: critical element] occurs at this stage.

Now we reach a decision point: [decision question]. If [condition A], we proceed to [Path A]. If [condition B], we go to [Path B]. [Explain the distinction].

[Continue through flowchart...]

The endpoint shows us [final outcome]. Understanding this flow helps you [application to NCLEX or practice].

[Transition to next slide]

[Word count: 130-150 per minute, max 450 words]
```

### Template: Comparison Table Slides

```
PRESENTER NOTES:

This comparison table will help you distinguish between [Item A] and [Item B]—a distinction NCLEX frequently tests. [PAUSE]

Looking at the columns, we have [Item A] on the left and [Item B] on the right. Let's work through each row.

First, [Dimension 1]: [Item A] shows [characteristic], while [Item B] shows [different characteristic]. [EMPHASIS: key discriminator] is the clearest difference here.

For [Dimension 2]: [explanation of comparison]. This matters clinically because [application].

[Continue through rows...]

When you need to differentiate these on the exam, ask yourself: [discriminating question]. That will point you to the correct answer.
