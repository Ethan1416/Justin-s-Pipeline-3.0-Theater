# STEP 2: LECTURE MAPPING
## 5-Phase Content Analysis for NCLEX Lectures
## Domain-Agnostic Version

---

## PURPOSE

This step analyzes the uploaded anchor point document through 5 sequential phases to:
- Learn the content landscape
- Discover natural groupings
- Map prerequisite relationships
- Form provisional sections
- Generate multiple arc iterations to inform sorting

**This step does NOT sort anchors.** It prepares the AI to make informed sorting decisions in Step 3.

---

## INPUT

The anchor point content summaries document uploaded in Step 1, containing:
- Domain name
- Numbered anchor points (testable concepts)

---

## DOMAIN ADAPTATION

This prompt is domain-agnostic. When executing:

1. **Extract the domain name** from the uploaded document
2. **Identify domain-relevant categories** for the Content Survey (Phase 1)
3. **Adapt cluster themes** to match the domain's content structure
4. **Form sections** appropriate to the domain's natural organization

---

## THE 5 PHASES

Execute each phase in sequence. Each phase builds on the previous.

---

## PHASE 1: CONTENT SURVEY
### Purpose: Familiarize with the anchor landscape

**Task:** Read ALL anchors and create a detailed inventory of what appears in the content.

**Identify and catalog content using domain-appropriate categories:**

First, determine what categories are relevant to this domain. Examples by domain type:

**For Biological/Physiological Domains:**
- Anatomical structures, neural pathways, body systems
- Disorders, conditions, syndromes
- Drugs, pharmacological agents, mechanisms
- Psychological processes (memory, emotion, perception)
- Research studies, paradigms, key researchers

**For Clinical/Assessment Domains:**
- Assessment instruments, tests, measures
- Diagnostic categories, disorders, syndromes
- Theoretical orientations, models
- Populations, demographics, special considerations
- Psychometric concepts, validity, reliability

**For Treatment/Intervention Domains:**
- Therapeutic approaches, modalities, techniques
- Disorders addressed, presenting problems
- Theoretical foundations, models
- Evidence base, research support
- Special populations, adaptations

**For Ethics/Professional Practice Domains:**
- Ethical principles, codes, standards
- Legal requirements, statutes, regulations
- Professional situations, dilemmas
- Decision-making models, frameworks
- Populations, contexts, settings

**For Developmental/Social Domains:**
- Developmental stages, milestones, processes
- Theories, theorists, models
- Social phenomena, group processes
- Cultural factors, diversity considerations
- Research paradigms, key studies

**Output Format:**

```
===== PHASE 1: CONTENT SURVEY =====
Domain: [extracted from document]
Total Anchors: [count]

CATEGORY 1: [Domain-Relevant Category Name] ([X] unique items, [Y] total mentions)

[Subcategory A]:
- [Item]: Anchors #[list] ([X] mentions)
- [Item]: Anchors #[list] ([X] mentions)
...

[Subcategory B]:
- [Item]: Anchors #[list] ([X] mentions)
...

CATEGORY 2: [Domain-Relevant Category Name] ([X] unique items)
...

[Continue for all relevant categories]

KEY OBSERVATIONS:
- [Notable patterns, heavily represented topics, gaps]
- [Any surprising concentrations or absences]
- [Themes that emerge across categories]
```

---

## PHASE 2: CLUSTER DISCOVERY
### Purpose: Identify natural groupings of related anchors

**Task:** Based on the Content Survey, group anchors into provisional clusters.

**Clustering Principles:**
- Group by conceptual similarity (anchors about the same topic/theme)
- A cluster should represent a coherent teaching unit
- Flexible threshold: clusters can have as few as 5 anchors (may merge later)
- An anchor can only belong to ONE cluster (make best judgment for ambiguous cases)

**Domain-Specific Clustering Guidance:**

Different domains have different natural cluster structures:

| Domain Type | Typical Cluster Patterns |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| Biological | By system (motor, sensory, memory), by structure, by process |
| Clinical | By disorder category, by assessment type, by severity level |
| Treatment | By modality, by theoretical orientation, by problem type |
| Developmental | By stage, by domain (cognitive, social, physical), by theorist |
| Ethics | By principle, by situation type, by stakeholder |
| Research | By design type, by statistical method, by validity type |

**Output Format:**

```
===== PHASE 2: CLUSTER DISCOVERY =====

PROVISIONAL CLUSTERS IDENTIFIED: [X]

CLUSTER: [Cluster Name]
Anchor Count: [X]
Anchors: #[list all anchor numbers]
Core Theme: [1-2 sentence description of what unifies this cluster]
Key Concepts: [main elements that define this cluster]

CLUSTER: [Cluster Name]
Anchor Count: [X]
Anchors: #[list all anchor numbers]
Core Theme: [description]
Key Concepts: [elements]

[Continue for all clusters...]

---

MULTI-FIT ANCHORS (could belong to multiple clusters):
- Anchor #[X]: Currently in [Cluster A], could also fit [Cluster B]
  - Reason for current placement: [brief rationale]

---

CLUSTER SIZE SUMMARY:
| Cluster | Count | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| [Name] | [X] | [Normal / Small - may merge / Large - may split] |
...

SMALL CLUSTERS (<9 anchors) - candidates for merging:
- [Cluster name] ([X] anchors) - potential merge with [related cluster]
```

---

## PHASE 3: RELATIONSHIP MAPPING
### Purpose: Understand how clusters depend on each other

**Task:** Analyze prerequisite relationships between clusters.

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- Which clusters provide foundational knowledge for others?
- What must be taught BEFORE other content makes sense?
- Which clusters are independent vs. dependent?
- How much frontloading/scaffolding does each cluster require?

**Prerequisite Patterns by Domain Type:**

| Domain Type | Common Prerequisite Patterns |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| Biological | Structure → Function → Dysfunction → Treatment |
| Clinical | Normal development → Psychopathology → Assessment → Diagnosis |
| Treatment | Theory → Techniques → Applications → Special populations |
| Developmental | Earlier stages → Later stages; Theory → Application |
| Ethics | Principles → Standards → Application → Complex dilemmas |
| Research | Concepts → Designs → Statistics → Interpretation |

**Frontloading Assessment:**
For each cluster, evaluate:
- Does this cluster require prior knowledge from other clusters?
- How much scaffolding is needed before this content is teachable?
- Would teaching this cluster early create confusion?

**Output Format:**

```
===== PHASE 3: RELATIONSHIP MAPPING =====

PREREQUISITE ANALYSIS (Narrative)

[Cluster A] serves as a foundational cluster because [explanation]. It provides the prerequisite knowledge needed to understand [Cluster B] and [Cluster C]. Specifically, concepts like [X, Y, Z] from this cluster are referenced in [specific anchors] from dependent clusters.

[Cluster B] depends on [Cluster A] for [specific concepts]. Without understanding [concept from A], anchors like #[X] and #[Y] in Cluster B would be confusing to students. However, Cluster B is independent from [Cluster C] because [explanation].

[Cluster D] requires extensive frontloading. Students must first understand:
1. [Prerequisite concept 1] - covered in [Cluster]
2. [Prerequisite concept 2] - covered in [Cluster]
3. [Prerequisite concept 3] - covered in [Cluster]
Teaching [Cluster D content] before these foundations would be pedagogically unsound because [specific reason with anchor examples].

[Continue narrative for all significant relationships...]

---

DEPENDENCY SUMMARY:

Foundational Clusters (few/no prerequisites):
- [Cluster name]: Can be taught early; provides foundation for [list dependent clusters]
- [Cluster name]: Independent content; minimal prerequisites

Dependent Clusters (require prior content):
- [Cluster name]: Requires [Cluster A], [Cluster B] first
- [Cluster name]: Requires [Cluster A], [Cluster C], [Cluster D] first

Culminating Clusters (require most prior content):
- [Cluster name]: Integrates knowledge from [multiple clusters]; must come late

---

FRONTLOADING REQUIREMENTS:

| Cluster | Frontloading Needed | Must Come After |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------|
| [Name] | None/Minimal | (foundational) |
| [Name] | Moderate | [Cluster A] |
| [Name] | Extensive | [Clusters A, B, C, D] |
...

---

SCAFFOLDING NOTES:
- [Any specific scaffolding sequences that must be respected]
- [Concepts that absolutely must precede others]
- [Warning: teaching X before Y would cause confusion because...]
```

## PHASE 4: SECTION FORMATION
### Purpose: Formalize clusters into proposed lecture sections

**Task:** Convert provisional clusters into formal section proposals.

**Section Formation Rules:**

1. **Target Section Count Formula:**
   - Total Anchors ÷ 15-20 = Target number of sections
   - Valid range: 4-12 sections total
   - Example: 174 anchors ÷ 17.5 = ~10 sections
   - Example: 120 anchors ÷ 17.5 = ~7 sections
   - Example: 85 anchors ÷ 17 = ~5 sections

2. **Section Size Guidelines (DYNAMIC MINIMUM):**
   - If 4 or fewer sections: 12-35 slides per section
   - If 5 or more sections: 10-35 slides per section
   - With ~1.15 anchors per slide + 3 fixed slides: ~7-28 anchors per section
   - Sections with <7 anchors should merge or become Misc
   - Sections with >30 anchors may need splitting

   **Why dynamic minimum?** More sections mean content is more distributed,
   so each section can be slightly smaller while maintaining adequate coverage.

3. **Special Cases:**
   - **Misc Section:** For orphaned anchors without a natural home; abstract/theoretical content that doesn't fit the main narrative
   - **Culmination Section:** For integrative content requiring knowledge from 3+ prior sections; complex applications that synthesize multiple areas

**Domain-Specific Section Patterns:**

| Domain Type | Typical Section Structure |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| Biological | Systems-based (motor, sensory, memory, etc.) + Clinical + Pharmacology |
| Clinical | By disorder category + Assessment methods + Differential diagnosis |
| Treatment | By modality/orientation + By problem type + Integration |
| Developmental | By stage or by domain + Theories + Applications |
| Ethics | By principle + By situation type + Complex dilemmas |
| Research | Design types + Statistics + Validity/interpretation |

**Output Format:**

```
===== PHASE 4: SECTION FORMATION =====

SECTION COUNT CALCULATION:
- Total anchors: [X]
- Formula: [X] ÷ 17 = [Y] sections (target)
- Actual sections formed: [Z]
- Rationale for deviation (if any): [explanation]

|---------|---------|-------------|--------|
| [Name] | [X] | [X×1.15+3] | [OK / Small / Large] |
...

Total Anchors Assigned: [X] / [Total] (should be 100%)
Unassigned Anchors: [None / List any]
```

---

## PHASE 5: ARC PLANNING
### Purpose: Generate multiple iterations of section sequencing

**Task:** Create up to 5 different iterations of how sections could be sequenced across Session 1 and Session 2.

**This phase does NOT select a final sequence.** It explores options to inform sorting decisions in Step 3.

**Constraints to Respect:**
- 2 sessions, 150 minutes each
- 72-90 slides per session
- Prerequisite relationships must be honored
- Culmination content (if any) comes at end of Session 2

**Evaluation Criteria for Each Iteration:**

1. **Prerequisite Integrity** - Does each section have its foundations taught first?
2. **Session Balance** - Are anchor/slide counts roughly balanced?
3. **Learning Flow** - Does complexity build progressively?
4. **Culmination Setup** - Does Session 2 end with integrative content?
5. **Logical Coherence** - Would a student find this sequence intuitive?
6. **Frontloading Efficiency** - Is scaffolding distributed appropriately, or front-heavy?

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid (Domain-Specific Examples):**

| Domain | Anti-Pattern | Why It's Problematic |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| Biological | Treatment before pathology | Can't understand drug mechanisms without knowing what's being treated |
| Clinical | Differential diagnosis before individual disorders | Can't differentiate what you haven't learned |
| Treatment | Techniques before theory | Techniques lack context without theoretical grounding |
| Developmental | Later stages before earlier stages | Development builds sequentially |
| Ethics | Complex dilemmas before principles | Can't resolve dilemmas without ethical foundation |
| Research | Statistics before design concepts | Stats meaningless without design context |

**Output Format:**

```
